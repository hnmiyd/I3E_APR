Your spaceship has struck an unknown planet known for having no free electrons! This means that there will be NO ELECTRICITY in this planet unless you find a special crystal that is purple in colour! That crystal will restore all the free electrons back into the planet for your spaceship to start and fly off! However, do be careful as mysterious blobs and squares of orange liquid will scald your skin!
Navigate the vast open planet cautiously as you find your way OUT of it! 

The goal of this game is to escape from your spaceship by breaking down the door with a tool found in the spaceship, find the different kinds of crystal (mainly the purple one) while avoiding obstacles and finish the game!

3 Types of Collectables are in the game: 
Orange crystal
Smartphone to contact others
Purple Crystal (collecting this finishes the game!)

Other items:
Wrench: used to break down the faulty door
Health packs: Heal the player, will not give extra heal if player is full health
Cellphone: Bring it back to the spaceship to signal for SOS!

Navigate around the harmful orange liquid swirling around the planet and find your way back alive!
